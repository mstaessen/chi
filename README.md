Installation
============

You cannot use this prototype without web server because of a bug in Chrome (AJAX cannot handle the file:// protocol). 

Therefore, install a web server (xampp for instance on windows, apache2 package for linux, mamp for mac).


Instructions for xampp (http://apachefriends.org)

1. Install it.
2. Clone this repository in xampp/htdocs/
3. Run the server (if it is not running already)
4. navigate to localhost/prototype, assuming you did not change the repository name


Instructions on how to use git

* You can find relevant information about the commands on help.github.com
* If you're a windows user, install msysgit (preferred) or cygwin (and install the git package).
